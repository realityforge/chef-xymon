# Configure the Hobbit client settings.

# You MUST set the list of Hobbit servers that this
# client reports to.
# It is good to use IP-adresses here instead of DNS
# names - DNS might not work if there's a problem.
# (Internally this will be translated to BBDISP and BBDISPLAYS
# variables in /var/run/hobbit/bbdisp-include.cfg)
#
# E.g. (a single Hobbit server)
#   HOBBITSERVERS="192.168.1.1"
# or (multiple servers)
#   HOBBITSERVERS="10.0.0.1 192.168.1.1"

HOBBITSERVERS="<%= node['xymon']['servers'].join(' ') %>"

# Hostname used by the client for its reports.
# Must match the name for this host in the Hobbit servers'
# bb-hosts file.

CLIENTHOSTNAME="<%= node["hostname"] %>"
